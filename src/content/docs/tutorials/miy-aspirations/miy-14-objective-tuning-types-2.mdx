Today more Objective types. Some of them (Skill level, Career in general and career level, Timed objectives) I already showed in [this post](/tutorials/miy-3-objectives), so I will not repeat myself. But if you have any questions to it - let me know!

As for Skill Objectives - you can set up that way anything that is defined as statistics, not only skills level.

## Trait Objective

This objective gets completed once a Sim gets certain trait, defined in the list. You can add more traits to the list, it will be enough to get one to complete the task.

## Buff Objective

Analogically, this objective gets completed once a Sim gets certain buff, defined in the list. And here as well, you can add more buffs to the list, it will be enough to get one to complete the task.

This objective can also look like this, if you want that this action repeats several times for the full completion:

## Situation Objective

This objective gets completed when your Sim participates in some event and reaches certain level of it (bronze, silver or gold).

The red arrow shows how many time you want a Sim to participate in this event. Here I placed "1", so I could actually also delete entire section :D If you have 2 or more, it makes more sense ;)

With yellow color I marked another value "1". Here it's the level that must be at least reached when completing this event.

1 stands for bronze level

2 - silver level

3 - gold level

If you delete this entire section about level - your Sim will just need to participate in an event, no need to reach any level.

## Mood Objective

You can also set up an objective to get into certain mood. It can be more than once, so interations can be set up here too.
