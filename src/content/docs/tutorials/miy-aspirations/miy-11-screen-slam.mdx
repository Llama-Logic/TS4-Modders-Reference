Once again, just to remind what we are talking about :D this is screen slam in the game, this popping icon with text underneath:

![What you see when you complete a level of an aspiration, in Polish](~/assets/miy-screen-slam-horse-ilkavelle.png)

In game tuning of Screen Slam is done with Snippet Tuning. This one does not have SimData, just tuning file.

For aspirations we use Screen slam for:

* Milestone Completion (so aspiration level completion)
* Entire Aspiration Track Completion - so at the very end, and the only difference is this one is bigger and has different text below, informing about completing the entire aspiration.

You can just duplicate the screen slam code, taking examplary TuningID from the Aspiration Tuning.

## Tuning file structure

1. Audio - this is an audio sound. Personally, I never change that, because I don't create audio sounds.

2. Display type - size

   1. Milestone complete uses Medium

   2. Track complete uses Large

3. Icon - I copied here again the Instance of our new aspiration icon, the same one I used in the Aspiration Track Tuning.

4. Text - I also don't change it here. I just make sure the correct strings is for Milestone Completion and for Track Completion.

For the comparison, below picture of the Track Complete:

## Creating your own aspiration

I created 2x Snippet Tunings:

* 1st for Milestone Completion
* 2nd for Track Completion

![Two Snippet Tunings for two screen slams](~/assets/miy-two-screenslams-ilkavelle.png)

Now go to Aspiration Tunings. Within each Aspiration Tuning copy the TuningId of created Snippet tunings.

For levels 1-3 it should be Milestone Complete.

For level 4th, or simply the last one, it should be Track Complete.

![The tuning of an aspiration, with Local Tunings expanded at the bottom. The milestone complete screen slam instance is hignlighted in both places](~/assets/miy-ref-screenslam-ilkavelle.png)

This change is done only in the Tuning file, so you don't need to make any changes within SimData this time.

Thank you for learning with me :)
