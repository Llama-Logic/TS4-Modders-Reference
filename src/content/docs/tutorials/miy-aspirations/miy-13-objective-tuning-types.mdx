Today I'll show you Objectives that count performed interactions. I was already talking about it [here](~/tutorials/miy-1-iterations-in-objectives).

But today I'll go to some details, because this objective type is quite often used.

## Type: Number of performed interactions

### 1st part - Objective completion type

1. **Iterations** - we can define how many times a Sim must perform certain interaction.

2. **Unique targets** - we can also define towards how many different Sims (or objects) a Sim must perform an interaction. For objects it's more tricky to make it working, I was sometimes struggling with it, but I think I managed to make it work at least once.

### 2nd part - Objective test

In both examples above the test is about a performed interaction. Affordances stands here for interactions.

1. **Interactions definition:**

* We can define interactions by their **TuningIds** (1)- how it is done in examples above.
* Or by **Interaction Tag** (2)
* Or by both - in such a case it will count if the interaction is on the list of affordances, or if it has a proper tag.

2. **Cancellation of interaction** - we can define that if we cancel an interaction once it already started, it will still count toward the completion of the objective:

3. **Moment of completion** - we can define when exactly we want to count an interaction as successfully completed:

* **InteractionStart** - the exact moment when a Sim starts the interaction, it will count.

* **InteractionComplete** - it will count only when a Sim finishes the interaction.

* **InteractionUpdate** - for this we need to specify also the time after which the interaction will be counted towards objective. In the example below time is set to 110 Sim minutes.

4. **Success criteria**

   You can define that completed interaction will count towards the objective ONLY when it finished with the SUCCESS result. In the example below it's about winning a game, but it can be as well about interactions between Sims. It will only work when interaction has such outcome defined: Success and Failure. Many interaction don't have it defined, so even if completed "successfully", for these interactions this will not work.

I will continue with other Objective types next time :) Stay tuned!
