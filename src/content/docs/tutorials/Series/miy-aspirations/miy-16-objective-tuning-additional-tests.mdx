Today the last part about Objective Tuning - I want to explain a little bit Additional test, that you can add to objectives (but you don't have to).

Depending on what kind of objective you want to create, additional tests can help you achieve that, adding additional requirement that your Sim (or their targets) needs to meet. Below few examples.

## Mood test

![An objective with various parts marked: 1. a mood test, 2. completion loots, 3. the display text, 4. the objective, 5. the satisfaction points, and 6. the tooltip](~/assets/miy-objective-tuning-mood-test.PNG)

In the example above, additional test is to be in Inspired mood while doing interactions listed in Objective test part. Of course, you can set up any mood you want.

## Trait test

You can set to have a trait, as an additional test. It can be either the trait that your active Sim has, or a trait of the target Sim. In the example below the test is that a target Sim must be a ghost, and the objective is to befriend a ghost.

## Relation test

You can also specify that you need to have a certain relation with a Sim with whom you interact. In the example below additional test defines that the relation must be of parents with their kids. And objective is to perform social interactions with the kids.

## Other examples

What else you can set up as additional test? For instance:

* Buffs
* Object state
* Career
* Skill
* Age etc.

Really, there's a lot of possibilities. I hope you now get the concept :)
