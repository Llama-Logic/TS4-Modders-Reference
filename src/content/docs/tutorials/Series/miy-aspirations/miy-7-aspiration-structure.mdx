Since I love creating aspirations, I decided to teach you how to make this mod as first. And I hope that till Christmas I'll cover enough to let you create some simple aspiration :)

Today I'll only indicate which files you need to create your own Aspiration.

Next days I plan to cover more or less each file type needed for aspiration. Some of these files will also be needed for the careers, like aspiration tuning or objectives.

So, to successfully create an aspiration you need following file types.

1. Aspiration Track tuning
2. Aspiration tuning
3. Objectives tuning
4. Snippet tuning (for screen slam)
5. Reward tuning
6. Strings - this one I believe is [already covered here](../miy-2-text-strings) and in other tutorials focused on Strings. But if you have still some questions, let me know :)
7. Icons ;)

There can be other files within an aspiration mod, but let's say this is the minimum set for your aspiration to work. Other things are quite optional, depending on what you want to achieve.

I decided, for this tutorial and this aspiration I will use the reward trait that is already in the game. We'll cover traits creation some other time. I don't want to overwhelm you guys :D

Ok, so today that's all. Only a short intro. Let me know in comments if you have already ideas for an aspiration that you'll create 😍
