Today continuation and last part of presentation various Objectives Types.

## Relations Objective

This objective gets completed if a Sim gains certain relation with other Sims.

You can set it up to complete for more than one Sim. In the example below you need to befriend 3 different Sims (unique targets).

All relevant relantions are listed. You can see a definition "match_any" - which means any of these 3 listed relations will be ok. But you can also set up in your objective to match all, example:

In this example you need to at the same time have 2 relations with another Sim - to be married to this Sim and to have Soulmates relation.

## Having object Objective

This objective is about having a certain object in your household, or inventory. You can define this object by its TuningId, or by a general Tag:

***TuningId definition:***

***Tag definition:***

You can actually set up many tests within this objective e.g.:

* is object on active lot?
* is the Sim with aspiration the owner of this object? (this will work only for object for which you can set up the ownership e.g. notebook)
* when the check should be made? - here when you exit the build buy mode
* etc. etc. many configurations to discover :)

## Earned money Objective

You can set up an objective about money earned.

![An earned money test shown in an objective, with TotalMoneyEarned highlighted](~/assets/MIY-objective-test-money-ilkavelle.jpg)

It can be total money earned by your Sim, like in the example above, but you can also set up a specific Tag, for example for royalties:

## Photo taken Objective

There is also a nice way to make an objective for taken photos. You can do it simply listing interactions to take photo, or there is this nicer way:

Here you can also specify taking photos in unique locations:

Or even photos of group of Sims:

## Perk Objective

You can have an objective to buy a certain perk. Perks are these bonuses that you can buy for e.g. fame points, or club points, or occult points, you just need to know what its tag.

## Final Note

As you can see, possibilities are almost endless. Well, almost ;) I often get stuck, because I have an objective in my head, but I can't find a way to actually make it in the game xD But for sure, there is a lot of ways to achieve various things. I didn't present all possible objective types, nor configurations. You need to discover some things on your own as well :)

The more you'll do, the more you'll learn :)

Next time, I will show the last thing about Objective Tuning, and then we'll move to other topics.

Thank you!
