Mod-It-Yourself is a series of tutorials written by Ilkavelle on [her Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/ilkavelle). This part of that series was mostly posted as part of her Simsmas Modvent Calendar in 2025. They go through the different parts of an aspiration and how to put them together to make your own. Many parts are also applicable to other kinds of mods.

This is an index of those tutorials. Here you'll find links to the various parts, along with brief descriptions of what you'll learn from them. They're divided by category, which you can skip to at the right, and they're also listed in chronological order below.
